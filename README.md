## üöÄ Why This Project Matters

### The Ticketing Industry Problem

The global event ticketing industry is plagued by several critical issues:

- **Scalping Epidemic**: Automated bots purchase tickets in bulk within seconds of release, artificially inflating prices by 300-1000%
- **Market Manipulation**: Secondary markets are controlled by large resellers who create artificial scarcity
- **Consumer Exploitation**: Fans pay excessive markups while legitimate buyers are priced out
- **Lack of Transparency**: Traditional ticketing systems are opaque, making it impossible to verify authenticity
- **Counterfeiting**: Fake tickets cause financial loss and venue security issues
- **Platform Monopolies**: Centralized platforms charge excessive fees and control the entire ecosystem

### Our Revolutionary Solution

This Anti-Scalper Ticketing dApp addresses these problems through innovative blockchain technology:

#### üîí **Built-in Anti-Scalping Mechanisms**
- **Fixed Price Cap**: Smart contracts automatically reject any resale above the original face value
- **Burn Fee Implementation**: Resellers pay a mandatory burn fee that removes value from the ecosystem, making scalping unprofitable
- **Transparent Pricing**: All pricing rules are encoded in immutable smart contracts

#### üåê **Decentralized Ownership**
- **True Digital Ownership**: Tickets exist as NFTs with cryptographic proof of ownership
- **No Platform Lock-in**: Users own their tickets independently of any centralized platform
- **Interoperable**: Tickets can be used across different platforms and services

#### üîç **Complete Transparency**
- **Public Verification**: Anyone can verify ticket authenticity on the blockchain
- **Transaction History**: Complete audit trail of all ticket transfers and sales
- **Open Source**: All code is publicly auditable for trust and security

#### üí∞ **Economic Fairness**
- **Fair Distribution**: Eliminates bot advantages through blockchain-based issuance
- **Reduced Fees**: No intermediary platforms taking excessive cuts
- **Value Protection**: Anti-scalping mechanisms protect consumer purchasing power

stacks_node_rpc_address = "https://api.testnet.hiro.so"
bitcoin_node_rpc_address = "http://blockstack:blockstacksystem@bitcoind.testnet.stacks.co:18332"
deployment_fee_rate = 10

[accounts.deployer]
# Replace with your actual testnet mnemonic
mnemonic = "your twenty four word mnemonic phrase goes here replace with actual wallet seed"
balance = 100000000000

[accounts.wallet_1]
mnemonic = "second test wallet mnemonic for multi user testing scenarios"
balance = 100000000000

   - Wait for blockchain confirmation

### Transferring Tickets

#### **Gift Transfer (Free)**
```typescript
// Example: Gifting a ticket to a friend
const giftTicket = async () => {
  await contractAPI.transfer(
    tokenId,
    senderAddress,
    friendAddress
  );
};
```

#### **Regulated Sale**
```typescript
// Example: Selling at or below face value
const sellTicket = async () => {
  await contractAPI.safeTransferWithPrice(
    tokenId,
    sellerAddress,
    buyerAddress,
    salePrice  // Must be <= FACE_VALUE
  );
};
```

### Viewing Ticket Information

```typescript
// Get ticket owner
const owner = await contractAPI.getOwner(tokenId);

// Get ticket metadata URI
const uri = await contractAPI.getTokenUri(tokenId);

// Get total supply
const totalSupply = await contractAPI.getTotalSupply();

// Check if ticket can be sold at a specific price
const canSell = await contractAPI.canSellAtPrice(tokenId, proposedPrice);
```

## üîí Security & Best Practices

### Smart Contract Security

Our contract implements multiple security layers:

#### **Access Control**
```clarity
;; Only token owner can transfer
(asserts! (is-eq tx-sender owner) (err ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED))
```

#### **Input Validation**
```clarity
;; Validate price constraints
(asserts! (<= sale-price FACE-VALUE) (err ERR-PRICE-EXCEEDED))
```

#### **Economic Security**
```clarity
;; Burn fee prevents profit from scalping
(asserts! (>= (stx-get-balance tx-sender) BURN-FEE) (err ERR-INSUFFICIENT-BALANCE))
(try! (stx-burn? BURN-FEE tx-sender))
```

### Frontend Security

- **Wallet Integration**: Secure connection handling without exposing private keys
- **Transaction Validation**: All transactions validated before submission
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for failed transactions
- **State Management**: Proper synchronization with blockchain state

### Operational Security

1. **Seed Phrase Management**
   - Never commit mnemonics to version control
   - Use environment variables or secure key management
   - Backup seed phrases securely offline

2. **Network Configuration**
   - Validate network settings before deployment
   - Use official RPC endpoints
   - Monitor for network issues

3. **Contract Verification**
   - Verify deployed contracts on block explorer
   - Test all functions on testnet first
   - Monitor contract activity post-deployment

---

## üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance

### Comprehensive Test Suite

Our testing strategy covers multiple layers:

#### **Unit Tests**
```typescript
// Example test case
describe("Anti-Scalper Contract", () => {
  it("should reject sales above face value", async () => {
    const result = await contractCall({
      function: "safe-transfer-with-price",
      args: [tokenId, sender, buyer, excessivePrice]
    });
    
    expect(result).toEqual(Err(ERR_PRICE_EXCEEDED));
  });
});
```

#### **Integration Tests**
- Wallet connection flows
- End-to-end ticket lifecycle
- IPFS metadata retrieval
- Cross-browser compatibility

#### **Load Testing**
- Multiple concurrent transactions
- High-volume minting scenarios
- Network congestion handling

### Running Tests

```bash
# Smart contract tests
cd anti-scalper
npm test
